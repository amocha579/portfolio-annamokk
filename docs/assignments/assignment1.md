# Assignment 1

My hunch was that new grads have trouble acclimating to new cities using existing social media apps, so I interviewed 2 new grads (1 male and 1 female for diverse acounts) that had just moved to Boston. 

**Interview 1: Abby, a female new grad who just moved to Boston**

The interview began by asking Abby, the interviewee, for an intro about herself and her current occupation and living status. She stated that she just graduated college in another state, and moved to Boston for work. Abby doesn't have friends in Boston but has minimal family connections. Subsequently, I asked about any social media she might use to connect with people in Boston. She described her usage of Boston subreddits and EventBrite, the former of which she used to ask questions about Boston culture and connect with others, and the latter of which she used to find local events to attend. Abby liked using Subreddits to ask questions about activities and neighborhood safety tips, but she was wary about Reddit tracking and selling her data. She still felt isolated from people, which is why she supplemented her interactions with Eventbrite and Bumble. She used Bumble to find friends who would go to Eventbrite events with her. However, she still found it hard to put herself out there and lacked the motivation to continue Bumble. The people that she found on Bumble didn't always have the same activity preferences that she did, and most of them had "already explored Boston and knew people". 

Abby was still looking for a centralized tool that motivated her to go to events and perhaps have a city-exploring buddy. Abby felt that Bumble was a little intimidating since she "had to match with people first before asking to see an event together". She preferred to have open group chats for each event instead. Overall, Abby seemed to be looking for a more beginner-friendly introduction to the city that didn't require matching with people directly.


**Interview 2: Morgan, a male new grad who also just moved to Boston**

The interview began very similarly with Morgan: when asked about his living status, he described how he moved from Texas to Boston after graduating from school for work. Morgan has used Facebook Marketplace to connect with people and events in Boston but "found it hard to join locked groups". He finds that other people usually have invites to Facebook groups, but he's a bit intimidated after getting "only a few acceptances into the groups" that he has reached out to. Like Abby, he'd love to have a city buddy who's either already knowledgeable about the city or completely new (like Morgan) and willing to go to events together. He has tried Hinge and other dating apps as well, but he's not just looking for a romantic partner. 

It stood out to me that a lot of the apps he used usually had only one main purpose: to connect with people solely by events or to find romantic partners. But Morgan also wishes to know general tips on transportation and safety, which natives seem to know implicitly. He has found it a little embarrassing to ask about things like the T, Blue Bikes, and where to rent low to mid-priced apartments. He used to also like "discount-chasing" with his friends, where he used to find local store discounts and prizes. Overall, it seems like Morgan would benefit from meeting people like Abby - both are newcomer grads who wish to learn about local knowledge and connect at events.  


**Design Opportunities**
- Gamified EventBrite with discounts
  - The new grads I interviewed can both easily benefit from attending events using Eventbrite. However, both Abby and Morgan seem to lack the initial motivation to put themselves out there. Morgan has stated that a lot of young people his age appreciate "discount-chasing". Perhaps the kickstart Morgan needs is to be rewarded with local store discounts for attending events. This will hopefully motivate the younger generation and newcomers alike, providing more diversity for connections. 

- City Exploring Buddy
  - Both Morgan and Abby seem to desire to have either a tour guide or another newcomer to explore the city with them. There could be options to try both: locals would provide answers to a lot of the questions that Morgan and Abby have about transportation and local safety, while fellow newcomers could provide companionship in learning about the city together. 

- New User Blogs
  - I envision a tool that has frequent new blogs about how to get started in the city. These will be written by newcomers instead of reporters/writers to get a fresher, more realistic take. The blogs can be upvoted/liked and the writers can provide their contact information to connect with fellow newcomers. 

- Social Geocaching
  - I imagine a map that people have virtually hidden messages on. To uncover the hidden messages, one must travel to that location. This is a fun spin on physical geocaching which is usually fixed. However, in social geocaching, the locations can change more dynamically, and the reward is more of a hidden message/request to connect, etc. I envision that people post about a certain location, and motivate users to travel there and obtain rewards. Users can be rewarded with discount points or internal app awards. 


**Planning Materials and Raw Interview Notes**

- Hunch = Young people find it hard to acclimate to new city -> app to connect with the city, each city has its own posts, people post about events in the city, shops they visit, and activities they do there. Can be anon or real identity. 

UrbanKickstart

- Personalized City Dashboard
Upon joining, users create a profile and provide their interests, hobbies, and preferences for social activities (e.g., music events, food festivals, art galleries, sports, etc.).
A personalized dashboard shows curated lists of events and activities happening around them, based on their preferences.
- City Onboarding Challenges
Fun challenges and tasks to help users explore their new city (e.g., “Visit 5 iconic landmarks,” “Try 3 local food spots,” “Attend a local market”).
Rewards, badges, or discounts for completing challenges.
- Local Events and Meetups
A calendar view of events happening in the city, such as concerts, street festivals, local markets, workshops, happy hours, and more.
Filters to sort events by type (e.g., social, networking, cultural), price (free vs. paid), and distance.
Option to RSVP, buy tickets, or share events with friends.
Similar apps = Eventbrite, meetup - but not unified platforms for customization and gamification 

Morgan:
- Moved for work, didn’t know anyone. Wasn’t very social within the city or communities, only with family connections
- Commute, trains he needed to figure out
- Housing, transportation, safety 
- Used Facebook Marketplace
    - Locked groups
    - People already know people
    - Secret invites
    - Not necessarily newcomers
- Hinge
    - For a romantic partner
    - Still wants city buddy
    - Pressure to match with someone

Abby:
- Moved for work, just graduated, doesn’t know anyone her age
- Eventbrite
    - Nice for finding events, just doesn’t know anyone to go with her
    - Hoping to meet people at events, but it’s intimidating to go alone
- Bumble
    - Pressure to match with someone before messaging
    - Not necessarily newcomers
    - Looking for someone who has a shared interest in activities
    - City buddy would be great
- Subreddits
    - Look up native knowledge on neighborhoods, places to eat
    - Likes that she can post anonymously but also feels disconnected that way

Reddit
- Community driven, so many open-ended topics, regulated by the community too, anonymity
- Don’t like how they scrape your data and harvest info, have to login sometimes for certain subreddits
- Selling user data to AI companies for money
- Happy if you had the choice for selling and you get paid, mad that you aren’t asked about it

Misc Ideas
- Social geocaching -> evolves on what other users post, not fixed geocaching
- Local eventbrites -> geocaching
- Gamified Eventbrite, geocaching, sign up for a “city buddy”
- Collaborations with local businesses, restaurants, gyms, and cultural centers to offer exclusive deals or discounts to app users.
- A dynamic map interface showing events, activities, and hotspots around the city, and also neighborhood notes, like “SUS” location
- Blogs on getting started in the city
